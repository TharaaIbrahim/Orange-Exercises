  <article style="color:orange;"> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</article><br><br>

  <article><b>Inline CSS</b> allows you to apply style rules to specific HTML elements. Inlining CSS means putting CSS into an HTML file instead of an external CSS. Since inline CSS allows the application of a unique style to one HTML element, its usage is limited but is beneficial for creating unique attributes.</article><br><br>

  <article>
      <div style="background-image: url(background.jpg); height:30%;">
      External style sheets to apply a rule to multiple pages, an external style sheet is used. An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet.
